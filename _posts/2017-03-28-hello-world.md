# 2017/03/28/first English diary blog


This is the first blog of my 'English diary'.    
English. English...   
many Korean people involve me...  maybe struggling to be a good English speakers.    
I also want to talk about my thought to the English speakers.   
But I used to be embraced at that time.   
Today was the usual day.   
I went to meet prof. Ahn for seeing his operation.   
There was a woman from Malaysia.   
She was a orthopedic surgeon.   
It is seldom case, I thought.   
Surely, we have to talk each other with English.   
My friends, Koo, talked skillful English.   
But I can not speak with her easily.   
I changed to a shy guy.   
I felt that my hand wobble.   

In these days, I was lazy to study everything involve English speaking.   
Today was embrassing day.   
Yes.   
I don't want make a day like today from now.   
### *_I resolve that I will be a influent English speaker._*
